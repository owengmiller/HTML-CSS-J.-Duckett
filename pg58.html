		<h1>The Story in the Book:</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1:</h2>
		<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about a hour now.
		On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>,
		and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well
		thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
		since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls, the more she
		felt she needed to be free.</p>
		<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster
		with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people
		who have nothing better to do.</q>Although many had considered her pioneering
		work, unravelling the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> to
		be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something
		better to do.</p>
